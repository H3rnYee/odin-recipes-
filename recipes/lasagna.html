        Lasagna's history traces back to ancient times with Greek "laganon" and Roman "lasanum," evolving into the layered pasta dish known today in Naples, Italy, during the Middle Ages, with the first recorded recipe appearing in a 14th-century English cookbook. While early versions lacked tomatoes, the dish transformed significantly over centuries, particularly in Italy, becoming a beloved comfort food with numerous regional variations.
