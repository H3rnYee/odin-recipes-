        Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, a classic Italian pasta dish meaning "spaghetti with garlic and oil," has a history rooted in Neapolitan cuisine, particularly associated with "cucina povera" or peasant food, making it a historically economical and easily prepared meal. While its origins are somewhat murky due to its humble beginnings, it's believed to have emerged from the Campania region of Italy, possibly even earlier than the 1800s, and was a favorite of King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon.
